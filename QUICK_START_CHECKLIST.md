2. Add Share Extension target
3. Add Keyboard Extension target
4. Import all 17 Swift files
5. Add Firebase package dependency
6. Enable App Groups capability

### ☐ Step 4: Configure App Settings (10 minutes)

**Update Config.swift with your values:**

```swift
// In Config.swift, update these:

static var apiURL: String {
    case .production:
        return "https://YOUR-FUNCTION-APP.azurewebsites.net" // ← Your Azure URL
}

static let azureClientId = "YOUR_AZURE_CLIENT_ID" // ← From Azure Portal
static let azureTenantId = "YOUR_AZURE_TENANT_ID" // ← From Azure Portal
static let bundleIdentifier = "com.YOUR_DOMAIN.app" // ← Your bundle ID
static let appGroupIdentifier = "group.com.YOUR_DOMAIN.shared" // ← Your group ID
```

**Where to find these values:**
- **Azure Function URL:** Azure Portal → Function App → Overview → URL
- **Azure Client/Tenant ID:** Azure Portal → Azure Active Directory → App registrations
- **Bundle IDs:** Use your own domain (e.g., com.yourname.replycopilot)

**Verification:**
- [ ] API URL updated to your Azure Function
- [ ] Bundle IDs match throughout project
- [ ] App Group identifier matches in all targets
