   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Provide a clear description of changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include screenshots/videos if UI changes

## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

### Swift Style

- Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow Apple's Swift API Design Guidelines

### Example

```swift
// Good
func generateReplies(from image: UIImage, tone: Tone) async throws -> [ReplySuggestion] {
    // Validate input
    guard let imageData = image.jpegData(compressionQuality: 0.8) else {
        throw APIError.invalidImage
    }

    // Make API request
    let response = try await apiClient.post(endpoint: "/generate", data: imageData)
    return response.suggestions
}

// Bad
func gen(i:UIImage,t:Tone)->Array<ReplySuggestion>{
let d=i.jpegData(compressionQuality:0.8)
return apiClient.post("/gen",d).suggestions
}
```

### SwiftUI Style

- Extract complex views into separate structs
- Use `@State` for local state
- Use `@Published` in ViewModels
- Keep view bodies under 10 lines when possible

### Comments

- Add educational comments for learners
- Explain "why" not "what"
- Document public APIs
- Add TODO/FIXME for known issues

```swift
// Good: Explains WHY
// Use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the server during outages
let retryDelay = pow(2.0, Double(retryCount))

// Bad: Explains WHAT (obvious from code)
// Set retry delay to 2 to the power of retry count
let retryDelay = pow(2.0, Double(retryCount))
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

While unit tests are not yet implemented, when adding tests:

- Write tests for business logic
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error handling
- Test edge cases
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage

## 📚 Documentation

When making changes:

- Update README.md if adding features
- Update relevant .md files in docs/
- Add inline documentation for public APIs
- Update CHANGELOG.md (if exists)
