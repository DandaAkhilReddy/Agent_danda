## 🎓 Educational Features

### Every iOS File Includes:

1. **LEARNING Comments** - Explains WHY code exists and iOS concepts
2. **Code Examples** - Shows good vs bad patterns
3. **Best Practices** - Professional patterns used in production apps
4. **Resources** - Links to official Apple documentation
5. **Practice Ideas** - Suggestions for hands-on learning

**Example from ReplySuggestion.swift:**
```swift
/**
 LEARNING: Swift Property Types
 ===============================
 let: Immutable (constant) - value cannot change after initialization
 var: Mutable (variable) - value can change

 WHY use let when possible?
 - Safer: prevents accidental modification
 - Clearer: signals intent (this shouldn't change)
 - Optimized: compiler can make assumptions

 RULE OF THUMB: Use 'let' by default, only use 'var' when you need mutability
 */
let id: UUID
```
