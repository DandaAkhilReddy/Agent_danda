/**
 ReplyCopilotApp - Main App Entry Point

 LEARNING: SwiftUI App Lifecycle
 ================================
 In SwiftUI, the @main attribute marks this as the app's entry point.
 This replaces the old UIKit AppDelegate pattern (though we still use AppDelegate for Firebase).

 The App protocol defines the structure of your app with:
 - @main: Tells Swift this is where the app starts
 - var body: Defines the app's view hierarchy
 - Scene: A container for your app's UI (windows, tabs, etc.)

 WHY SwiftUI vs UIKit?
 - SwiftUI: Modern, declarative, less boilerplate
 - UIKit: Older, imperative, more control
 - This app uses SwiftUI with UIKit integration where needed
 */

@main
struct ReplyCopilotApp: App {

    // MARK: - Properties

    /**
     LEARNING: @UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor
     ========================================
     This property wrapper connects the old UIKit AppDelegate to SwiftUI.
     We need this for Firebase initialization and other iOS lifecycle events.

     WHY use AppDelegate in SwiftUI?
     - Some SDKs (Firebase, push notifications) require AppDelegate
     - Gives access to lifecycle methods not in SwiftUI
     - Bridge between old (UIKit) and new (SwiftUI) patterns
     */
    @UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self) var appDelegate

    /**
     LEARNING: @StateObject
     =======================
     Creates and owns an ObservableObject that survives view updates.
     Use @StateObject for creating objects that the view owns.

     Difference from @ObservedObject:
     - @StateObject: View creates and owns it (persists across view updates)
     - @ObservedObject: View observes it but doesn't own it
     - @EnvironmentObject: Passed down from parent view

     Here we create ViewModels that manage app state:
     - AuthService: Handles Firebase and Azure AD authentication
     - StorageService: Manages UserDefaults, Keychain, App Groups
     - AnalyticsService: Tracks user behavior for Firebase Analytics

     LEARNING: @AppStorage
     ======================
     Property wrapper for UserDefaults - perfect for simple preferences.
     Automatically syncs with UserDefaults and triggers view updates.

     WHY use @AppStorage?
     - Simple: No need to manually read/write UserDefaults
     - Reactive: View updates when value changes
     - Type-safe: Compile-time checking

     When to use what:
     - @AppStorage: Simple values (bool, int, string) in UserDefaults
     - Keychain: Sensitive data (passwords, tokens)
     - Firestore: User data that needs cloud sync
     - App Groups: Data shared between app and extensions

     LEARNING: Scene-Based Architecture
     ===================================
     The body defines your app's UI structure using Scenes.
     WindowGroup is the most common scene for iOS apps.

     Scene hierarchy:
     1. App (top level - ReplyCopilotApp)
     2. Scene (WindowGroup, DocumentGroup, etc.)
     3. View (Your SwiftUI views)

     WHY WindowGroup?
     - Automatically handles multiple windows on iPad
     - Manages state restoration
     - Handles scene lifecycle (foreground, background)

             LEARNING: Conditional View Based on State
             ==========================================
             SwiftUI makes it easy to show different views based on state.
             Here we show onboarding for new users, main content for returning users.

             This is the core of reactive UI:
             - State changes â†’ View automatically updates
             - No manual view controller management needed

 LEARNING: UIApplicationDelegate
 ================================
 The traditional iOS app lifecycle manager.
 Still needed for certain iOS features that SwiftUI doesn't cover yet.

 WHEN to use AppDelegate:
 - Firebase initialization (requires early app lifecycle hook)
 - Push notification registration
 - URL scheme handling (deep links)
 - Background fetch setup
 - Third-party SDK initialization

     ORDER of execution:
     1. AppDelegate.didFinishLaunching
     2. SwiftUI @main App init

         =================================

         STEPS to set up Firebase:
         1. Create project at console.firebase.google.com
         2. Download GoogleService-Info.plist
         3. Add to Xcode project (drag into Xcode)
         4. Call FirebaseApp.configure()

         - Authentication: Easy user management
         - Firestore: Real-time database
         - Analytics: User behavior tracking
         - Crashlytics: Crash reporting
         - Remote Config: Feature flags

 Extensions add functionality to existing types.
 Great for organizing code and keeping view code clean.

 - Add computed properties
 - Add convenience methods
 - Conform to protocols
 - Organize large files

 CANNOT do in extensions:
 - Add stored properties
 - Override existing methods

// MARK: - Documentation

/**
 KEY CONCEPTS LEARNED:
 =====================

 1. SwiftUI App Structure
    - @main marks entry point
    - App protocol defines structure
    - Scene-based architecture (WindowGroup)

 2. State Management
    - @StateObject for owned ObservableObjects
    - @AppStorage for UserDefaults
    - @EnvironmentObject for passing down hierarchy

 3. AppDelegate Integration
    - @UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor bridges UIKit
    - Still needed for certain iOS features
    - Handles app lifecycle events

 4. Firebase Setup
    - Configure early in app lifecycle
    - Required before using any Firebase service
    - GoogleService-Info.plist must be in project

 5. App Lifecycle
    - Launch â†’ Active â†’ Background â†’ Suspended
    - Save data in didEnterBackground
    - Refresh in didBecomeActive

 NEXT STEPS:
 ===========
 - Read ContentView.swift to see main app UI
 - Read OnboardingView.swift for first-run experience
 - Read AuthService.swift for authentication logic
 - Read StorageService.swift for data persistence
